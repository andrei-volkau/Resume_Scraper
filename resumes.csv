Junior Python Developer

Innovative Junior Python Developer who has been developing academically for the past eight years to create elegant code that both looks and performs well to solve complex problems.

As an explorative programmer, I know that so long as I can clearly communicate the problems I am attempting to solve and the means I wish to apply to them with my team, we can quickly and efficiently overcome them. I believe that the ideal company can build the right team to achieve the right goals. Such teams would work to clear away any obstructions in the path to the final product, starting from a shared knowledge base and a plan to expand work outward from a starting location to navigate to the sought solution. I am a firm believer of KISS, Agile, 3rd way over compromise, OO Design and clean code.

I am looking for a full-time position in Texas.

UNIVERSITY PROJECTS[MS in CS]:

TITLE: Developed a database based website for Student health centre [Sep 2014 – Dec 2014]
DESCRIPTION: University Health Center which is planning to improve communications with students by developing a
new program utilizing MySQL & PHP. As soon as a student, schedule an appointment to visit a Doctor/Nurse in Health
Center, a record is added to existing database. The new system should send email to: The students who scheduled an
appointment to remind the date/time of the appointment, Students who visited the Health Center to get feedback regarding their experience with Health Center, Students who need to schedule an appointment in future (with tentative date), Students on birthday/many days in advance, All students regarding a public announcement.

TITLE: Developed basic Employee Management System [Sep 2014 – Dec 2014]
DESCRIPTION: The proposed system will assist the admin in organizing the details of the employees like adding, deleting,
searching and updating the employee details into the and from the database. Admin can check the employee attendance,
salary and the system automatically deduct the salary based on his/her leaves. The employee can mark his attendance, can apply for leave, check his leave and can search for other employee details.

TITLE: LZW Algorithm of Lossless Data Compression for WSN [Sep 2014 – Dec 2014]
DESCRIPTION: A novelistic scheme for compression and decompression of encrypted images. The input image is first
encrypted by a modulo 256 addition to pseudo random numbers generated by a secret key and then divided into a number of sub images and then the Hadamard coefficients are applied to the image to compress the image. The decoder decrypts the image with a rough data using the secret key provided by the encoder, and then iteratively updates using the Hadamard coefficients to obtain detailed information about the original image to reconstruct the image. The performance of this technique is successfully addressed by enhancing this method by using LZW Algorithm Technique while reconstructing the original data. The algorithm can distinguish between pseudo random number and a random number. Thus making this method more secure, accurate and time efficient when compared to other methods.

TITLE: Developed Software Architecture for Inventory Management System [Jan 2014 – May 2014]
DESCRIPTION: The core concept is to provide our registered customer with features like Order, Complaint, and Annual
Maintenance cost (AMC) services and also can track their request. When registered customers logs in they can order the
products in dropdown list, these orders of a particular user can also be viewed later for reference. There a room for product insurance which is called as AMC where in users can secure their product by buying AMC for a certain period of time. User can buy either new AMC or extend the existing one by updating it. Complaint forum is created to manage the system if there is any damage/failure in the product purchased, overall, a user friendly system is created for online purchase and the system also focuses on satisfying the customer requirements.

TITLE: Developed Architecture for Object Oriented Development Tool [Jan 2014 – May 2014]
DESCRIPTION: Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools provide automated assistance for software development. The goal of introducing CASE tools is the reduction of the time and cost of software development and the
enhancement of the quality of the systems developed. Our tool allows software engineers to Create, Modify, Update, Save
and Delete objects and diagrams used for the design of software products.

TITLE: Improving Reliability in WSN by Collaborating Robust Data Aggregation and CRT-based Packet
Forwarding Technique (POC-IEEE) [Sep 2013 – Dec 2013]
DESCRIPTION: Provided with a novel forwarding technique based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) in WSN’s.
In particular, we have provided a method in which there is minimum energy consumption and remarkable improvement in performance. Starting from choosing the CRT algorithm parameters in order to keep the processing complexity low, then we have derived tradeoffs between energy consumption and reliability. The prime numbers are obtained and the algorithm is run and the resulting output is shown. The obtained output clearly shows that the performance of the CRT based algorithm is better than Non-CRT based algorithm.
